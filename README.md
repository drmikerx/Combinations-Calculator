# Combinations-Calculator
This program introduces itself and then generates and displays two randomly generated
numbers. One is n, which will be in the range 3 to 12, and the other is r, which will
be in the range 1 to n. It then asks the user for their input on the number of combinations
that can be chosen based on the numbers generated for n and r. User input is received as a
string and converted into an int. If the string contains non-numeric characters an error
message will display and user will be re-prompted. The program then calculates the correct
answer to the question via a recursive algorithm. The user's input is compared to the
correct answer and the user is told whether they were right or not. Lastly, the user is asked
whether they would like another problem. Input is validated to be either y or n. If y, the
program presents another problem. If n, the program ends with a goodbye message.
